-EERD (Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram)

-Database and Table Creation

-Constraints (Check, Default, Auto-increment)

-Indexes and Inheritance

-Views for simplified querying

-Stored Procedures and Triggers

-Data Visualization with Microsoft Excel


Data Visualization:
The Excel file included (excel_visualization.xlsx) contains dashboards, pivot tables, and charts built from SQL query results to provide insights into the data.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to showcase a full-cycle, real-world database implementation that can be applied to systems like inventory management, HR systems, or academic databases.

Technologies Used:

-SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL compatible)

-Microsoft Excel

-MySQL
